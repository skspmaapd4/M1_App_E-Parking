**Introduction**

This project is about Parking Management System. This system provides vacant parking slots up to date in the vicinity and reduces the traffic issues due to illegal parking along the roads.

**Research**

1. • A 2006 study by the Central Road Research Institute in New Delhi estimated that of the 8,760 hours in a year, an average car&#39;s steering time is only 400 hours. This means it is driven for only about an hour a day.
2. • Each car needs/ occupies an average of three different parking locations in the city every day. The land required to park a car is approx. 23 sq. m, which includes the space occupied by the vehicle as well as the minimum space needed to move it into and out of the space. This is called equivalent car space, or ECS.
3. • Therefore, each car effectively consumes 69 sq. m. of land every day, most of which is public land.
4. • On the other hand, a very poor family (EWS) in Delhi gets a plot or apartment of 25 sq. m.
5. • Delhi, in other words, allots more public land per day for parking cars than it does to house its poor. And all this for only 20 per cent of city&#39;s population which have a family car, based on figures of the 2008 Household Survey by the Department of Transport, GNCTD. 1 Source: Centre for Science and Environment courtesy India Environmental Portal Parking Policy as a Travel Demand Management Strategy DRAFT October 2010

increases. Ultimately, this leads to lowered densities within cities to a point where transit becomes inefficient. Street life and public spaces cease to function.&quot;

Car Parking Management systems were developed in the early 20th century in response to the need for alleviating the search for vacancy in the parking area.

**Cost estimation:**

**Estimated cost = hours needed to build an app \* cost per hour to build an app.**

**Features**

- Logging details about the vehicle.
- View the availabale space in the garage.
- Display arrival and departure of the vehicle.

**Features to be added in future:**

- Integrate GPS routing system with this mobile application to guide the users to vacant position.
- Ability to reserve their space in the garage from mobile application.
- Integrate RFID tag operation with the mobile application for seamless payment facility and update the vehicle occupation within blink of an eye. (fully automated parking system).

**SWOT Analysis:**

| **Strengths (internal)**·       Unique service app·       Can be scaled up nationally and globally·       Innovative app that will make finding a parking spot quick, cheap and easy·       Has no competitors in the locality/community/city.·       Relatively cheap service app·       Trial version will allow users to know if they want to use the service. | **Weaknesses (internal)**·       Inexperienced management and employees·       High cost start-up and promotion·       High chance of malfunctions, glitches or bugs·       Not everyone has a smartphone or an android capable of using the service. |
| --- | --- |
| **Opportunities (external)**·       Expand nationally and internationally·       Implement social media to help promote the app·       &quot;In App&quot; advertising (major revenue source)·       Establish a good and reliable service app and improve it as much as possible·       Population growth leading to more cars | **Threats (external)**·       Limited financial funding for start-up costs and launch of app·       New competitors are likely to provide same service in other cities·       Government and ACCC regulations·       Lobbying groups influencing consumer perceptions |
